            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Government agencies using this platform struggled with collaboration during the records request fulfillment process. Staff members were using the internal note tool to discuss requests, causing conversations to be confusing and out of order.</p>

        <!-- Initial Ideation Section -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
            <p>Before this project started, a coworker conducted a research study that uncovered a need for a larger communication section of the product which includes internal and external comms. Since that research validated the need for the feature, I started by ideating how we could create the internal collaboration feature.</p>
            
            <h3>Framing the Space</h3>
            <p>I started working on this project by defining the goals, writing HMW statements, and establishing some initial questions.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            
            <h3>Generating Ideas</h3>
            <p>I tried to think of as many ideas as possible for how we could integrate the chat into the existing product</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            
            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>After evaluating the initial concepts with stakeholders, I developed wireframes for the most promising approach: a chat system that combined a persistent chat panel with contextual in-line comments. I gave them a few options to consider based on the amount of effort we'd want to put into building this feature.</p>
