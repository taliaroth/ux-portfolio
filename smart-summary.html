            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project explored the integration of AI technology to improve record request processing for government agencies. Through a mixed-methods research approach combining in-depth user interviews and large-scale feedback collection, we validated that AI-generated request summaries would significantly enhance workflow efficiency for agency staff. The research not only confirmed strong user interest with over 66% of surveyed users rating the AI summaries highly, but also provided critical insights into implementation considerations, allowing for informed decision-making about feature placement, permissions, and display options as we move toward implementation.</p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Government agencies process numerous record requests daily, requiring staff to manually review and extract key information from often lengthy and unstructured request descriptions. This manual process is time-consuming, prone to inconsistency, and creates bottlenecks in request processing workflows.</p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To evaluate the potential value of AI-generated summaries for record request processing, I conducted a two-phase research study combining qualitative interviews with quantitative validation to understand user needs and reactions to the proposed feature.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm whether users want an AI request summary</li>
                <li>Learn what type of information the AI request summary should provide</li>
                <li>Determine how the AI request summary would improve their workflow</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Method 1: Personal Inventory Interviews</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Participant Profile:</strong> Engaged with 6 power users who regularly assign, fill, and manage record requests</li>
                <li><strong>Research Format:</strong> One-on-one sessions where participants shared representative request examples and highlighted critical information</li>
                <li><strong>Information Gathering:</strong> Users demonstrated their workflow and identified key elements they look for when processing requests</li>
                <li><strong>Request Analysis:</strong> Observed patterns in what information users prioritize and how they extract meaning from unstructured request text</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Method 2: AI Summary Evaluation Survey</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Development Process:</strong> Created AI-generated summaries based on insights from interviews</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Approach:</strong> Designed a mock record request with corresponding AI summary for evaluation</li>
                <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Collected 150 responses from active product users</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Used a 5-point rating scale and asked about likelihood of use</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Gathered qualitative responses about benefits and concerns</li>
            </ul>
